# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. It aims to identify and extract subjective information, such as attitudes, opinions, and emotions, from various sources like customer reviews, social media posts, and survey responses.
In essence, sentiment analysis helps us understand whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This information can be invaluable for businesses, researchers, and individuals seeking to gain insights from textual data.

This project demonstrates a basic sentiment analysis implementation using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. We will use the **compound score** generated by VADER Lexicon, which is a normalized, weighted composite score, to determine the overall sentiment.
